                    Hi! I'm Anderson. I sometimes get called an old man because 
                    I like classical music, 
                    but besides that I'm pretty normal. I play piano, badminton, 
                    and sometimes do some math. 
                    In my spare time, I enjoy programming and teaching myself new things.
                </p>

                    Hi im isaac, your average delulu kpop stan, and probably the 
                    least experienced pianist here. My only instrument is piano, 
                    but i know how to play hot cross 
                    bun on the recorder, and I'm pretty proud of that! Personally, 
                    my music taste is all over the place, but mainly i listen to 
                    kpop and classical. Stan newjeans!!!
                </p>
